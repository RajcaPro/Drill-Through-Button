# Drill Through Button

Hey everyone !
I hope you are doing great :)

Today I come to you with an idea. 

Suppose our business problem contains a note like this :
create a report that contains a start page and one report page : Executive Summary. The home page is to present a shortcut linking only to this one page of the report. 
People using this report will primarily use this page. But the bosses themselves want us to create an additional report page especially for them, which will not be displayed to other users ( we will talk about permissions in one of the next posts :) ). 

The question is do we have to create a new report ? 
We could, but in our case we did not get permission to do so.

So the question is what to do ? 

With the help of Drill Through comes to us !
with this, we can use the button created to send the user to another report page, which we have previously hidden !
